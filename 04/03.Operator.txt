# Level 1: Easy (Basics)

1. What are operators in JavaScript?
Operators are the symbols that performs operations on operands.

2. Name **five types of operators** in JavaScript.
Assignment , logical , airthematic , unary , bitwise. 

3. What does the `typeof` operator return?
It return string which indicate the type of the operand's value like undefined , string , object etc.

4. What will be the output?

   ```js
   console.log(typeof "Hello"); 
   //It's output will be string because it is string data type.
   ```
5. What will be the output?

   ```js
   console.log(typeof 100);
   number
   ```
6. What is the output?

   ```js
   console.log(typeof true);
   boolean
   ```
7. What does the `instanceof` operator check?
It is used to check weather a object is instance of a class or constructor or not. It checks whether an object inherits from a constructor’s prototype.

8. What will this return?

   ```js
   [] instanceof Array

   It will return true.
   ```

# Level 2: Medium (Understanding & Application)

9. Predict the output:

   ```js
   console.log(typeof null);

   'object'
   ```
10. Predict the output:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof undefined);

    'undefined'
    ```
11. What will be printed?

    ```js
    let x = 10;
    let y = "10";
    console.log(x + y);

    "1010" because y is a string and + performs concatition in string(type coercion)
    ```
12. Predict the output:

    ```js
    let a = 10;
    let b = 5;
    console.log(a > b); --> true
    console.log(a <= b); --> false
    ```
13. What is the difference between `typeof` and `instanceof`?
The typeof operator return a string which indicates the type of operand's value but instanceof return boolean value which tells us weather a object is an instance of a class or not.
typeof cannot detect arrays and instanceof fails across execution contexts (iframes).

14. Predict the output:

    ```js
    let arr = [];
    console.log(typeof arr); --> object
    console.log(arr instanceof Array); --> true
    ```

15. What will this log?

    ```js
    console.log(typeof function () {}); --> function
    ```

# Level 3: Hard (Tricky & Conceptual)

16. Predict the output and explain:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof NaN); --> number because NaN is a special numeric value.
    ```
17. Predict the output:

    ```js
    console.log(10 + "5" - 2); --> 103 because 10+"5" = 105 and 105-2 = 103.(type coercion) and - forces numeric conversion
    ```
18. What will this return?

    ```js
    let obj = {};
    console.log(obj instanceof Object); --> true because obj belongs to object and All objects inherit from Object.prototype unless explicitly changed.
    ```
19. Predict the output:

    ```js
    let value = "5";
    console.log(typeof (value + 5)); --> "string" because + operator perform concatition in string and 5 will be concaneted in value.(type coercion)

    ```
20. Why does this give an unexpected result?

    ```js
    console.log(typeof []); --> because Arrays are objects in JavaScript; there is no separate array type.
    ```

# Level 4: Practical Questions (Hands-On)

21. Write code to check whether a variable contains a **number** using `typeof`.
let a = 33;
typeof a === "number"


22. Write code to check whether a variable is an **array** using `instanceof`.
let arr =[];
arr instanceof Array;

23. Write a small program that:

    * Stores two values (number + string)
    * Adds them
    * Prints the **result and its data type**

let a =22;
let b='2';
let c = a+b;
console.log(c); --> 222
console.log(typeof c); --> 'string'


24. Write a condition that prints:

    * `"Valid number"` if the value is a number
    * `"Not a number"` otherwise
      *(Use only `typeof` and operators)*
let a=2;
(typeof a === 'number')?console.log("Valid number"):console.log("Not a number");



25. Explain when you would prefer `instanceof` over `typeof` with an example.
I will prefer instanceof when I want to know weather my object is the part of a particular class or constructor and I will be using typeof when I want to konw the data type of my operands or variable. eg.
typeof []        // "object"
[] instanceof Array // true
